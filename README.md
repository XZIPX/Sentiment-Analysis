## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that involves determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text. This project specifically focuses on analyzing sentiments expressed in tweets using the Naive Bayes classification algorithm.

## Dataset

This project utilizes an entity-level sentiment analysis dataset from Twitter. The dataset comprises messages associated with specific entities, and the goal is to determine the sentiment of the message towards the mentioned entity. The dataset includes three sentiment classes: Positive, Negative, and Neutral. Messages that are not relevant to the entity are categorized as Neutral.

The dataset used in this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis/data).


## Usage

1. Open the twitter_sentiment_analysis.ipynb notebook in Jupyter.
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the code.


## Testing

1. Locate the cell dedicated to testing/prediction.
2. Input your own text or use provided test cases to observe sentiment analysis predictions.
3. Run the cell to generate predictions and evaluate the model's performance on new data.
